# Laptop Price Predictor

## Overview
The Laptop Price Predictor is a machine learning project designed to estimate laptop prices based on various features. The model predicts market prices using historical data on laptop specifications.

## Features
- **RAM**: The amount of memory in the laptop, measured in GB. More RAM typically enhances performance and can affect the laptop's price.
- **Weight**: The weight of the laptop, measured in kilograms. Lighter laptops may be priced higher due to portability features.
- **Storage**: The type and capacity of storage (HDD or SSD) in the laptop. SSDs often lead to higher prices compared to HDDs due to better performance.
- **Touchscreen**: Indicates whether the laptop has a touchscreen. Touchscreen laptops generally cost more because of their added functionality.
- **Price**: The target variable for our predictions, representing the market price of the laptop based on the given features.
